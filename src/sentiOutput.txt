In both life and death, Mughal emperor Aurangzeb remained close to his favourite son, Prince Azam Shah. After Aurangzeb's death, Prince Azam knew it was time to bury his father in the Deccan and leave for North India to claim the throne. En route, he had to leave a member of his entourage, Shivaji's grandson Shahuji (later Chhatrapati Shahu I), who had been captured by Aurangzeb. And Shahuji was thereby "injected back into the Maratha polity".
